title: Hello, world!

I'm Justin, a full stack software engineer currently based out of southern Pennsylvania. I've had a lifelong passion for everything computers, with web development being the throughline of my journey so far.

My expertise lies predominantly in React/TypeScript based applications, where I have proven myself across duties ranging from the design and development of applications to deploying and maintaining their underlying infrastructure. As far as frameworks are concerned Next.JS has been my go-to, but I've also worked with Gatsby, Laravel, Astro, and am never afraid to learn something else if it's the optimal solution.
            
I'm always seeking new opportunities, and am open to relocate for the right ones! If you'd like to have a conversation, don't hesitate to reach out to me on any of my socials listed in the footer below.
