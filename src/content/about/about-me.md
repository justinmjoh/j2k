title: WHOIS Justin?
---
I spent much of my life on the west coast. I grew up in and around the tech hub of Seattle, where much of my childhood was spent tearing apart electronics. I knew programming was what I wanted to do with my life after seeing 2010's Tron: Legacy. My appreciation for synthesizers and 80's design cues weren't far behind. By early highschool, I was attending workshops at DigiPen Institute of Technology where I gained AI/robotics, PHP stack web, and Java based game development skills. Sadly, most of these projects have been lost *a la* poor USB drive "version controlling" but that may be for the best... After highschool, I earned an Associate's from Bellevue College and then later my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from The University of Arizona.

I escaped the desert in 2024 and followed my family back to the east coast, where in the time since graduating I've gained experience all across the IT/development landscape. Outside of the office, I dedicate a lot of time to web and microcontroller based projects. Check my blog to see what I'm up to.

Besides tech, I'm passionate about audio and music, motorcycles, reading, and weightlifting. My DM's are always open, please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or your shared interests.
